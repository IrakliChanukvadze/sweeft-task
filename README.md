# sweeft-task

## Overview

&nbsp; Sweeft-Task is designed to build an application for browsing through a large list of users. The goal of the project is to implement an infinite scroll logic to enable step-by-step fetching of users' data without overloading the server. Additionally, the application is designed to provide a detailed view of a user's profile and their friend's list, with the same infinite scroll logic implemented for the friend's list. \
&nbsp; There are two branches for this project. In the main branch, I implemented the scroll logic using a scroll event listener. In the second branch, called "intersection", I implemented the scroll logic using the IntersectionObserver API.

### The challenge

-Infinite scroll logic for browsing users' list and friends' list.
-We can not use any existing infinite scroll libraries for this project.

## My process

### Built with

-React js
